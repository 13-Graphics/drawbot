Teaching with DrawBot
---------------------

Python is a great language for introducing the basic concepts of programming to entry level students. There are many tutorials and introduction packages available for the language (see the `overview on the python site`_). 

DrawBot combines the easy to learn Python with a compact but powerful application in which code, result and feedback are visible at a glance. This section collects scripts and advice on how to specifically use DrawBot in a programming course.
Step by step

Each of the scripts on this page focus on a particular section of Python. Click on the link and copy the text of the script to a new DrawBot window. Read the comments (the lines starting with a #) for clues and help.

Basic math
----------

How do numbers look in Python? how to write simple sums, multiplication, substrations etc.

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/basicmath.py

Strings
-------

Strings contain text, a sequence of letters like beads on a string. This script shows what strings can do. 

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/strings.py

Variables
---------

Variables are similar to storage boxes, they need to have a name and contain something. This script shows how to name variables in Python, and some neat tricks they can perform. 

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/variables.py

Lists and loops
---------------

Lists are sequences of things, like a string is a sequence of letters. But lists can contain things like numbers, variables and other lists. Loops are uses to jump through a list and look at 
each one of the items. Loops are a powerful and fast way to work with lots of items. 

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/listsloops.py

Functions
---------

Functions are small programs with the program. Rather than write something over and over again, you can write a function and recycle the code in different parts of your program. 

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/functions.py

Conditions
----------

Sometimes your program needs to respond to particular values or situations. If this value is 4, then go there. If it isn't, just go on. 

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/conditions.py

Random numbers
--------------

Fun things to do with random numbers. The computer is full of them.

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/randomnumbers.py

Shapes
------

Drawing a couple of the basic shapes. Have a look at the Drawing Primitives pages for a detailed overview of shapes. 

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/shapes.py

Colors
------

Shapes can also be colored. This script shows how work with shapes in colors and transparency values. 

.. showcode:: /../examples/courseware/colors.py
