The Preview area is where your generated graphics are displayed.

Current page
------------

The main preview area shows the drawing canvas or current page.

The zoom level can be increased with `Cmd+` and decreased with `Cmd-`.

In case of multi-page documents, the visualization settings can be changed by right-clicking on the page and choosing between single or double pages and continuous or individual.

Pages overview
--------------

Besides the current page there is also a secondary pane to the left where all pages can be seen at once (in case of multi-page documents). This pane is hidden by default, and can be opened by pulling the vertical division to the right.
