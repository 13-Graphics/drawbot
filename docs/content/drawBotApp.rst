DrawBot App
===========

.. image:: assets/drawBotApp.png

Drawbot has three main views:

* A :doc:`drawBotApp/codeEditor`: the place to write code
* An output view for `print` statments and tracebacks. (reports when your script fails)
* The :doc:`drawBotApp/preview` will preview the current page and when you have multiple pages an overview of all the generated pages.

The :doc:`drawBotApp/preferences` contains some settings related to the appearance of the DrawBot editor.
